Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: Git is an extremely useful version control system which all programmers
        should use to keep track of their coding projects. With git, you can keep 
        track of the history of your coding project and what changes you have made
        and when. This is especially useful with large projects in which a small 
        change may break a few things or cause cascading errors. Git keeps a log 
        of all your committed changes and ensures you can retrieve an older 
        version of the project. Additionally, git also allows you to collaborate
        with other team members, such that each member has a local copy of the 
	project on their machines, and can push, pull, and merge changes once 
	they are done with a part/section of the work.
