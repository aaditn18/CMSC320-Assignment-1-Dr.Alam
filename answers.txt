Answer: Data science can be applied to various fields, such as healthcare.
        For example, data science techniques can analyze patient records, 
        medical images, and genetic data to predict disease risk, personalize 
        treatments, and improve patient outcomes. By identifying patterns 
        and correlations in vast amounts of healthcare data, data science 
        can help healthcare providers make more informed decisions, optimize 
        resource allocation, and enhance the overall quality of care.
